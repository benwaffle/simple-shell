Bugs:
- some race conditions could occur when receiving SIGCHLD
- echo with variables doesn't work in a pipeline

Test cases:
- ls >out >out2
- ls >>out >out
- ls >out | cat
- cat | ls <in
- ls | ls &
- I also used various other test cases to test pipes, more error handling, and background processes
